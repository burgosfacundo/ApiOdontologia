# ApiOdontology

This is an integrative project that I carried out within the framework of the Certified Tech Developer career of Digital House for the Back End I subject.

It is a simple API for a dental office.I used the JAVA language with the Spring Boot framework and also used Spring Security for API security with a JWT.
